Fix ANR crash on non-Planet devices when Planet SDK is unavailable

- Made SDK initialization asynchronous to prevent UI thread blocking
- Added SDK availability detection with graceful error handling
- Added checks in payment operations to verify SDK availability before use
- Enhanced error handling to catch native crashes when SDK libraries are missing

Backward compatible: No impact on Planet POS/IM30 devices. On non-Planet 
devices, app now starts normally with payment features gracefully disabled.
